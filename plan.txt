version 2  -- 1 of September:
In order to make crawler faster we can crawl multiple domains,
for example, we can crawl only markafoni and will get 35000 products in 20 minutes,
but if we will crawl 3 different domains:
	ebay, amazon, markafoni
we can get three times more products in 20 minutes.
1. I will improve parsing speed
2. I will make that you can run multiple instances of crawlers, on multiple machines
3. I will make better table structure
4. Will sovle the problem of crawling full domain

version 3 -- 8 of September:
1. Will ensure that even with 10000 threads, the crawler works properly
2. Will make web service, with it you can add new domains via http protocol
3. will test data handling on a big data sets
